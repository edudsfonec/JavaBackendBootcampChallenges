# JavaBackendBootcampChallenges

This repository houses my initial set of Java programming challenges, completed as part of a backend development bootcamp. These exercises were crucial for solidifying my understanding of fundamental algorithms and honing my problem-solving skills in Java.


## About the Project

`JavaBackendBootcampChallenges` documents my journey through the early stages of a programming bootcamp focused on backend development with Java. Each challenge within this repository represents a discrete problem designed to:

* Reinforce core Java syntax and concepts.
* Improve algorithmic thinking.
* Practice effective problem-solving strategies.
* Build a foundational understanding for more complex backend development tasks.

This collection serves as a personal log of my progress and an illustration of how I tackled introductory programming problems.


## Technologies Used

* **Java:** The primary programming language used for all challenges.
* **IntelliJ IDEA :** For writing, compiling, and running the Java code.


## Structure

The repository is organized by individual challenges or problem sets. Each challenge typically includes:

* The problem statement (either in comments or a dedicated file).
* My solution code.
* (Potentially) Test cases or examples used to verify the solution.


## Learnings

Completing these challenges has significantly enhanced my:

* **Algorithmic thinking:** Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps.
* **Debugging skills:** Identifying and fixing errors in my code.
* **Java proficiency:** Gaining practical experience with Java's features and libraries.
* **Backend foundation:** Preparing me for the intricacies of backend development.
